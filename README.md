To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game board will be displayed on the screen, and you can click on each cell to make your move. The first player to get three in a row wins the game. If no player has won and all cells are filled, the game ends in a tie.

Have fun playing!

P.S. This README.md file was also written entirely using ChatGPT.
